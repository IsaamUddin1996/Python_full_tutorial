# Take age or year or birth as an input from the user and tell them when they will turn 100 years old.
# (5 points) Donâ€™t use any type of module like datetime or dateutils(-5 points).
# They can then optionally provide a year and your program must tell their age in that particular year.
# (3 points) You should be handling all sorts of errors like (2 points):
#     You are not yet born
#     You seem to be the oldest person alive
#     You can also handle any other error if possible!
